# distribution-scripts

This repository contains work towards implementing the plan outlined
in <https://hackmd.io/AWds-AnZT72XXsbA0oVC6A>.

We will use Python (TODO: 2 or 3? Max is for 3, the future is there),
as it is more powerful than shell scripts, and arguably more portable.
It also offers packages for everything

For starters, we work on separate steps of the plan in separate files.

Non-goals: turning this into a "proper" Python package. 

`make_packages.py` needs [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)
